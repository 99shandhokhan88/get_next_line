## Introduction

The "Get Next Line" (GNL) project is a fundamental exercise that challenges your ability to read content line by line from a file descriptor or input stream in C. This guide provides an overview of the project, its purpose, how to get started, and advanced topics for customization and improvement.

## Project Overview

In the GNL project, you are tasked with writing a function, `get_next_line`, that reads a single line from a file descriptor or input stream every time it is called. The goal is to handle dynamic memory allocation, allowing you to read and return lines of arbitrary length while minimizing memory usage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To work with the GNL project, you need the following prerequisites:

- A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, or similar).
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC).

### Installation

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git@github.com:99shandhokhan88/get_next_line.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd get_next_line
   ```

3. There isn't a Makefile because of the subject.

## Usage

### Function Description

The `get_next_line` function reads a line from a file descriptor (e.g., a file or standard input) and returns it as a dynamically allocated string. The function signature is as follows:

```c
int get_next_line(int fd, char **line);
```

- `fd`: The file descriptor from which to read.
- `line`: A pointer to a character pointer where the line will be stored.

The function returns:
- `1` if a line was read successfully.
- `0` if the end of file (EOF) has been reached.
- `-1` on error.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `get_next_line` function:

```c
#include "get_next_line.h"

int main(void)
{
    int fd;
    char *line;

    // Open a file for reading
    fd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);

    while (get_next_line(fd, &line) > 0)
    {
        // Process the line
        printf("%s\n", line);
        free(line);
    }

    // Close the file
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```

## Here's how the project typically works:

1. **Initialization:** At the beginning of the function or loop that reads lines, you initialize a static buffer and other necessary variables to keep track of the read data and the current state.

2. **Reading from File/Stream:** You use a function like `read()` or `fgets()` to read a chunk of data from the file or input stream into the buffer. This chunk may contain one or more lines, or it may contain a partial line that extends beyond the buffer.

3. **Buffer Parsing:** After reading a chunk into the buffer, you parse the contents of the buffer to find complete lines. This involves searching for line terminators, such as newline characters (`'\n'`) or carriage return characters (`'\r'`). The goal is to identify where one line ends and the next begins.

4. **Handling Partial Lines:** If a line is split across buffer reads, you need to handle it. You may need to concatenate the partial line from the previous buffer with the new chunk and continue searching for line terminators.

5. **Line Extraction:** When you find a complete line, you extract it from the buffer and return it. The line is usually returned as a string or a line of text.

6. **Buffer Management:** After extracting a line, you need to manage the buffer. This includes shifting any remaining data in the buffer to the beginning and updating variables to reflect the new buffer state.

7. **Repeat:** You repeat the process of reading, parsing, and extracting lines until you reach the end of the file or stream.

Here's some simplified pseudo-code to illustrate the concept:

```python
# Initialize buffer and other variables
buffer = ""
while True:
    # Read a chunk of data into the buffer
    chunk = read_data_from_file()

    # Add the chunk to the buffer
    buffer += chunk

    # Parse the buffer for complete lines
    while '\n' in buffer:
        line, buffer = extract_line(buffer)
        yield line  # Return the extracted line

    # Check if we've reached the end of the file
    if end_of_file:
        break

# Return any remaining data in the buffer as the last line
if buffer:
    yield buffer
```

In practice, the `get_next_line` function is implemented in C, and it often uses a static buffer that retains its state between calls. The function reads data from a file descriptor using the `read()` function, searches for newline characters, and handles partial lines as described above. The extracted lines are typically returned as pointers to dynamically allocated memory.

The key challenge in the `get_next_line` project is managing the buffer efficiently and correctly, especially when dealing with edge cases like very long lines or files without a final newline character.

## Customization

You can customize the GNL project to fit your requirements. You may want to modify the buffer size, error handling, or memory management to optimize the function for your specific use case.

## Advanced Topics

### Memory Management

Efficient memory management is crucial in the GNL project. Explore techniques for dynamically allocating and freeing memory to minimize memory leaks and optimize resource usage.

### File Descriptors

Understand the use of file descriptors in the context of GNL. Consider handling multiple file descriptors or input streams concurrently and efficiently.
