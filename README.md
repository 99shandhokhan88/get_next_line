## Introduction

The "Get Next Line" (GNL) project is a fundamental exercise that challenges your ability to read content line by line from a file descriptor or input stream in C. This guide provides an overview of the project, its purpose, how to get started, and advanced topics for customization and improvement.

## Project Overview

In the GNL project, you are tasked with writing a function, `get_next_line`, that reads a single line from a file descriptor or input stream every time it is called. The goal is to handle dynamic memory allocation, allowing you to read and return lines of arbitrary length while minimizing memory usage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To work with the GNL project, you need the following prerequisites:

- A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, or similar).
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC).

### Installation

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git@github.com:99shandhokhan88/get_next_line.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd get_next_line
   ```

3. There isn't a Makefile because of the subject.

## Usage

### Function Description

The `get_next_line` function reads a line from a file descriptor (e.g., a file or standard input) and returns it as a dynamically allocated string. The function signature is as follows:

```c
int get_next_line(int fd, char **line);
```

- `fd`: The file descriptor from which to read.
- `line`: A pointer to a character pointer where the line will be stored.

The function returns:
- `1` if a line was read successfully.
- `0` if the end of file (EOF) has been reached.
- `-1` on error.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `get_next_line` function:

```c
#include "get_next_line.h"

int main(void)
{
    int fd;
    char *line;

    // Open a file for reading
    fd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);

    while (get_next_line(fd, &line) > 0)
    {
        // Process the line
        printf("%s\n", line);
        free(line);
    }

    // Close the file
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```

## Customization

You can customize the GNL project to fit your requirements. You may want to modify the buffer size, error handling, or memory management to optimize the function for your specific use case.

## Advanced Topics

### Memory Management

Efficient memory management is crucial in the GNL project. Explore techniques for dynamically allocating and freeing memory to minimize memory leaks and optimize resource usage.

### File Descriptors

Understand the use of file descriptors in the context of GNL. Consider handling multiple file descriptors or input streams concurrently and efficiently.
